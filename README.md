This processor supports data transfer (mov), constant addition (addi) and Unconditional Jump (J) instructions only. The processor implements forwarding to resolve data hazards. The processor has Reset, CLK as inputs and no outputs. The processor has instruction fetch unit, register file (with 8 8-bit registers), Execution and Writeback unit. Read and write operations on Register file can happen simultaneously and are independent of CLK. The processor also contains three pipelined registers IF/ID, ID/EX and EX/WB. When reset is activated the PC, IF/ID, ID/EX, EX/WB registers are initialized to 0, the instruction memory and registerfile get loaded by predefined values. When the instruction unit starts fetching the first instruction the pipeline registers contain unknown values. When the second instruction is being fetched in IF unit, the IF/ID registers will hold the instruction code for first instruction. When the third instruction is being fetched by IF unit, the IF/ID register contains the instruction code of second instruction, ID/EX register contains information related to first instruction and so on. (Assume 8-bit PC. Also Assume Address and Data size as 8-bits)

## Instructions

### mov DestinationReg, SourceReg 

Moves data in register specified by register number in Rsrc field to a register specified by register number in RDst field. Opcode for mov is 00

### addi DestinationReg, immediateData 

Adds data in register specified by register number in RDst field to sign extended data in immediate data field (2:0). Result is stored in register specified by register number in RDst field. Opcode for addi is 01

### j L1 

Jumps to an address generated by appending 2 MSB bits of PC+1 to the data specified in instruction field (5:0). Opcode for j is 11
